    "Music streaming has uppended the music industry in irreversable ways. Gone are the days of cd distribution and mp3 players with capacity constraints. Today, consumers can access nearly any song ever create - from top artists to recently-minted SoundCloud singer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instant access to music with significantly less financial barriers supports the experimentation and exploration of various music forms that conusmers would have passed on in previous phases. Given this, it is helpful to understand how listeners consume music: which genres, artists, and - because there is less emphasis on records - which songs and content. On content, the messages that are or aren't conveyed in music can speak to an artists strategic and creative approach. The following will explore the content in today's music through a process of Natural Language Processing analysis."
