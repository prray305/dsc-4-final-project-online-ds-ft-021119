    "Music streaming has uppended the music industry in irreversable ways. Gone are the days of CD distribution and mp3 players with capacity constraints. Today, consumers can access nearly any song ever create - from top artists to recently-minted SoundCloud singer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instant access to music with significantly less financial barriers supports the experimentation and exploration of various music forms that conusmers would have passed on in previous phases. Given this, it is helpful to understand how listeners consume music: which genres, artists, and - because there is less emphasis on records - which songs and content. On content, the messages that are or aren't conveyed in music can speak to an artists strategic and creative approach. The following will explore the content in today's music through a process of Natural Language Processing analysis."

I'd also like to focus on acquiring data through APIs and webscrapping. Most importantly is my interest in musicians and the art they produce, and possibly gaining better understanding in how they influence, with their words, me at the least."

Tell you what you mean to me Every time you wander I\\'ll be your eyes so you can see I wanna show you things That I never showed no other, I wanna be More than your mother More than your brother I wanna be like no other If you need me, I\\'ll never leave I know, that you know, without you there is no me There is no me Without you there is no sea There is no shore Love is too weak to define how much I adore You child, you child The last words you hear \"Be with me darlin\\' til the end of all time I\\'ll give you my heart I\\'ll give you my mind I\\'ll give you my body I\\'ll give you my time For all time I am with you   You are with me You are with me',\n",
